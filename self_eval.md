# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?

*Using a `conditional` statement in your code is useful because they enable a program to make decisions based on different conditions. It allows the code to assess if a variable meets a variety of different conditions or none at all, which I think is particularly useful when needing to determine if a variable meets a complex criteria.*


2. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?

*I still need some clarity around best pracitices in testing ruby in a irb session in the terminal and then moving the code to the file.*


3. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?

*The first code challenge had us assess whether an integer was odd or even, which exposed me to new ruby commands. So when it came time to test multiples, I assumed there was a handy command for that, and I tested a few based on that assumption. That is how I came across the modulo command, and it was cool to do some successful trial and error based on that deduction rather than immediately googling the answer.*
